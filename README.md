## ‚ÑπÔ∏è A Confidential Email from Secret Service Dept.

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project simulates a confidential email message layout, styled to resemble a classified document.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## üîç Overview

The Confidential Email Page is a creatively styled HTML-CSS mockup of a sensitive government document. It features warning labels, a fixed-width main layout, and sections of blurred text to imply redacted or hidden content.

The goal of this project was to practice creative use of CSS properties like `filter`, `transform`, and custom variables, while strengthening understanding of layout and visual hierarchy. It‚Äôs a fun and thematic challenge focused on presentation.
